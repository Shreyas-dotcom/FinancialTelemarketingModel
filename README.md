## Background: 
Telemarketing calls, when unsuccessfully not only waste the time of the banking institutions but also of the call recipients whilst also diminishing the chance of the customer returning to the bank for its services. It increases operating costs with limited success. With the use of a predictive model, selective targeting can be done, saving both time and money. ​Creating a special Random MLP model to help predict the likelihood of a successful outcome from a telemarketing call for banking customers in terms of updating their current plan with the bank. ​

The data set of investigation that we have chosen is that of Bank telemarketing. The set of data that we have is from a Portuguese banking institution, based on real-world phone calls and marketing campaigns in Portugal. The data was originally collected in 2017 and ranged to 2018.  Our team has chosen to investigate this because, on a day-to-day basis, we receive numerous telemarketing calls - with a number of them being scam calls. Our team chose to investigate how official telemarketing calls from a banking institution would play out; what their success rate would be, and what their outcome would be with respect to the call recipients' financial standings, age, education, and marital status. 

The data set provides us with 17 features and includes over 45000 instances. Using the information provided we hope to be able to investigate/predict the success in getting people to subscribe. This result will be in the form of a Boolean Response (Yes/No), or for our usage, Binary (0/1). This particular dataset consists of 7 numerical features, and 10 non-numerical features, accumulating into a grand total of 17 multivariate features. It analyzes a person’s marriage status, occupation, and other important aspects of their life in order to determine the correlation between them and success. The data consists of the success of telemarketing phone calls to primary and secondary bank account holders	' main registered phone numbers, and consists of anonymous data including but not limited to: 
Age
Job
Marital Status
Education
Loan status
Financial Standing 
Deposits
Line of Credit

Our goal is to utilize the data points listed above to attempt to predict the probability of a given client participating in the intended telemarketing product and agreeing to buy into the financial product. On the data analysis and more technical side, our team has discovered through the use of pandas the correlation pattern of our data. Essentially, based on our discoveries, the outcome of the call is most correlated to the duration of the phone call.
